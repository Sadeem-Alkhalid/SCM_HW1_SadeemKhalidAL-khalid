SCM Homework Assignment: Version Control and Change Management by Sadeem Khalid Alkhalid.
As part of my work for SCM,I created this repository to complete Homework1.

Best practices in SCM:

Software Configuration Management ensures that every change is tracked, versions are managed accurately, and project information stays consistent.
It strengthens team collaboration, minimizes conflicts during development, and keeps the workflow organized.
Good SCM practices also include writing clear commit messages, using structured branching strategies, documenting changes properly, and managing issues effectively to maintain high software quality.
