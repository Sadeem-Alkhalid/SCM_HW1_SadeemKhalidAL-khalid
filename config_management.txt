Configuration management plays a critical role in software development as it enables teams to monitor, organize, and control all changes made to the project. 
  It helps maintain consistency across versions, reduces integration issues, enhances team collaboration, and provides the ability to revert to previous states when needed.
  By managing changes effectively, it contributes to producing stable and reliable software.
